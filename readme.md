Full Stack Developer
--------------------

As a quality-driven FullStack Web Developer, I have a strong passion for building websites that are both responsive and stunningly attractive. I have had many opportunities to hone my abilities in creating excellent web applications, including working on a research project during my college years and competing for my teams in several national-level competitions. I have excellent problem-solving abilities and am capable of coming up with original solutions to difficult problems because I am a self-motivated and enthusiastic person. I am committed to delivering projects on time, within budget, and to the highest standards of quality. I'm looking to advance my career in MERN Stack development, and I'm excited to use my outstanding presentation and communication skills in a stimulating workplace. I am also skilled at working in teams and have the capacity to perform well under pressure. I'm motivated to keep up with the newest technologies, trends, and best practices by my passion for web development. I am excited to take on new challenges in this field because of my confidence in my ability to contribute to the success of any project.
